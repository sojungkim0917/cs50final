Video presentation:
"Hello this is the CS50 final project, the android app “ABC123” developed by Casey, Sishir, and SoJung. We wanted to create an app for young children (under 10 years of age) to expand on and practice their literacy and math skills. Literacy and math are the foundations for everyone’s education and are essential to our quest for knowledge. ABC123 provides a means in the technology age of education for children to get excited about learning and have a little fun while doing it."
"The app is colorful and vivid to attract the eye of the child and increase particiapation and desire to play. The user interface is simplistic and straightforward with minimal complexity in navigation. The main page after launch has two buttons allowing the child to choose their desired subject, ABC (for Literacy) or 123 (for Math)."
"Literacy has flashcards of the alphabet and 2 levels of testing (level 1 and level 2). In the literacy quizzes, if you get a correct answer you will be given the option to speak the word from a pop up display. For all quizzes, scores will be kept. When you reach a certain threshold of accuracy, a "reward" is given! Studying is not fun, but there are numerous ways to make it more interesting and pleasant. This app is one way for that. Hope you enjoy!"
