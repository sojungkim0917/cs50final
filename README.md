***Possible difficulty setting/age or grade option { table return based on user input, cross referencing tables of parameters}

App name: Smile, ABC 123!
Casey - design the UIs, make main page, correct the buttons leading to right pages
SoJung - Look for more open sources (for test bank piece, animation, database), look how into database is incorporated
Everything can be in images but have to be saved into drawable folder in res
For math, it could be sequencing or string
Youtube video/GIFs for reward in testing mode
*Youtube video can be deleted, so maybe download/redirect*
Sishir - Look for background (consistent throughout the app), decide which page would be dynamic/static (dynamic = when you get the correct answer, sun rises or color of the background changes)

Colors to use
Fonts
Graphics/banners
Animations/videos?
