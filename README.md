ANDROID STUDIO SETUP

    1. If you don’t have android studio, download android studio to your computer. You can find android studio download at https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html
    2. Run the software.
    3. Once the software is downloaded, navigate to the Studio Projects folder in your C: directory and add the project file to it.
    4. Open the project in Android Studio. If the application prompts to download multiple modules, please do so. It will not run without them.
    5. Create a virtual device emulator in android studio to view the app. Directions can be found at https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator.html
    6. We have used Pixel, with Marshmallow version, API v  23. Please run that for consistency. If having issues, Nexus S API v 23 also works great.
    7. Once the emulator has been added and the project has loaded, Go to the toolbar in the Android Studio and click “run” at the top in the toolbar.
    8. The emulator will then open and run the app. If the app does not run, navigate the emulator as you would a phone to the app “ABC123” and click the app to open it.
    9. If you're experiencing sluggish performance on Android Studio and the emulator, please close out all other open applications. The
       Studio and Emulator are very resource-intensive and seem to lag if you have mutliple tabs on Chrome or Safari open at the same time.
