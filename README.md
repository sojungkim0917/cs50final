Video presentation:
"Hello this is Casey, Sishir, and SoJung. We are developers of ABC123. We wanted to make an app for children age under 10 to expand literacy and practice math problems. Literacy and math are bound together and are essential and very basic parts of our lives. It would be great if children can learn these basic skills fun and happily."

"The app is colorful and vivid for children to be attracted. It has very easy interface - the main page has two choices leading to ABC and 123, and each button leads to either literacy or math problems. In literacy quiz, if you get a correct answer, a button to speak the word will be displayed. For all quizzes, scores will be counted and upon hitting certain points, a "reward" is given!"

"Studying is not fun, but there are numerous ways to make it interesting and fun. This app would be one of the ways for that. Hope you enjoy!"
